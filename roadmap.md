# CV Builder Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

The CV Builder is a web application that allows users to create, edit, and download their CVs. The application will use Next.js for the frontend, Drizzle for database interactions, Shadcn-UI for UI components, and Clerk for user authentication.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Setup

- [x] Create a new Next.js application.
- [x] Install necessary dependencies:
  - [x] Drizzle ORM
  - [x] Clerk for authentication
  - [x] Shadcn-UI for UI components
  - [x] Tailwind CSS (optional)
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS (if using).
- [x] Configure Clerk with API keys and authentication routes.

### Phase 2: User Authentication

- [x] Implement user registration and login using Clerk.
- [x] Create protected routes to ensure only authenticated users can access the CV builder.
- [x] Add user profile management (optional).

### Phase 3: CV Builder UI Development

- [x] Design the main CV builder interface.
  - [x] Create a form for user input (name, email, skills, experience).
  - [x] Use Shadcn-UI components for consistent styling.
- [x] Implement live preview of the CV as users fill out the form.
- [x] Add validation to ensure required fields are filled.

### Phase 4: Data Management with Drizzle

- [x] Set up Drizzle to connect to your database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- [x] Create models for storing user data and CV information.
- [x] Implement functionality to save user input to the database when the form is submitted.
- [x] Retrieve saved CV data for editing.

### Phase 5: PDF Generation and Download

- [x] Integrate a library (e.g., jsPDF or html2canvas) to generate PDFs of the CV.
- [x] Implement a download button that allows users to download their CV as a PDF file.

### Phase 6: User Subscription with Stripe

- [x] Integrate a user subscription tier checkout page.
- [x] Allow users to change tier subscription plans.
- [x] Users can cancel their subscription plans.

### Phase 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components and functions.
- [ ] Conduct user testing to gather feedback on usability and features.
- [ ] Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.

### Phase 8: Deployment

- [ ] Prepare the application for deployment (environment variables, build settings).
- [ ] Deploy the application using Vercel or another hosting provider.
- [ ] Monitor performance and user feedback post-launch.

### Phase 9: Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Add additional templates/styles for CVs.
- [ ] Implement social media links or portfolio sections in the CV.
- [ ] Allow users to import data from LinkedIn or other platforms.
- [ ] Enable multi-language support.

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to building the CV Builder application. Each phase can be adjusted based on project needs and timelines. Regularly review progress against this roadmap to ensure timely completion of tasks.
